//! Provides methods for drawing on an image.
/*!
 * This is a drawing area on which we shall draw a Life representation.
 *
 * Here some information on the canvas properties:
 *
 * 1. The drawing area has the origin set to the top left corner, with
 * positive `X` axis going to the right and positive `Y` axis going to
 * the bottom of the canvas.
 * 2. A pixel on the canvas has a square shape based on the pixel size
 * set when the canvas is instantiated.
 * 3. Because of 2, we have the `virtual` dimension (set by the client),
 * and the `real` dimension, which is w * pixel_size by h * pixel_size.
 *
 * This class returns to the client an image (object) representation
 * of the canvas, which might be stored by the client as a PPM or
 * PNG image file.
